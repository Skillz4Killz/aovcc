Instead, they paid their most trusted friends a generous amount, enough to raise a newborn all the way to adulthood, and entrusted them their offspring so that they could continue seeking out grand new worlds without needing to lug around a whining child.\n\nThat was how Roxie’s grandfather grew up. It was how her father grew up. Roxie herself, too, was no different. The only childhood memories she had of her parents were letters that came every few months long as the intrepid couple hadn’t managed to trap themselves in some mysterious crypt or gotten too immersed in exotic locations to remember to write to their only child.\n\nRoxie envied the lifestyle of her parents to no end. She remembered little about either of them, but their letters spoke of happiness and romance, and Roxie, being young and full of imagination, was completely sold. 'The day will come when I set off on an adventure of my own and meet my Prince Charming,' she would always say.

With it came a treasure map Roxie’s parents had lovingly drafted, marking countless explored and unexplored treasure locations. On the birthday card were the words: 'Go on, search for everything you could ever want. We look forward to meeting you somewhere along the way! Love, Mom and Dad'.\n\nThis was clearly her cue to set off on her first adventure! Roxie could hardly wait. She had her backpack and her mining pick. She was ready for Roxie’s Grand Adventure.\n\n'What about me? You should call it ‘Agnie and Roxie’s Grand Adventure’,' the fire spirit complained, poking its head out of the backpack.\n\n'Who cares about you? I don’t even need you.'\n\n'Bet you won’t be able to even read the map without me, dummy!'\n\nRoxie couldn’t really argue with that. Agnie was right, for Roxie, despite her aspirations to become the greatest explorer to have ever been born, was hopeless with directions. She could barely tell which side of the map was up.

He was a legend of the savage eras, not only bearing witness to the beginning and end of the war between Humans and Afata and the two Darkness Invasions, but also faithfully guarding all living beings on the Moonlight Plains with his Cosmic Totem.\n\nThe mystical Cosmic Totem, known to have seen it all from the very birth of the universe, was actually an Andura Shard, holding the power of time. It was how Baldum remained immortal, never to decay or die despite all the decades that had passed. However, the Totem’s powers protected Baldum only and no one else thus, he was doomed to watch his clan, his people, depart from the living world one by one through the years, leaving Baldum as the only centaur in Athanor.\n\nFor a long period, people believed that Baldum was but an ancient myth, and even most inhabitants of the Elborne Woods were unsure whether Baldum was still alive. Not until Volkath, the Dark Lord, made his comeback with his Lokheim army, were the mortals able to truly see him with their very own eyes. He had his back towards everyone, but seeing him fight his way against the swarms of Lokheim was enough to raise the morale of all Afata troops, who lived the rest of their lives with the image of this magnificent warrior engraved in their minds.\n\n'After I buried my last relative, I ran twelve laps around the crypt according to our clan customs. My forefathers said that by making the ground quake with our hooves, we would awaken Mother Earth, who would come call her children home.' ",

I planted it on the burial grounds of my people, to commemorate the brave battles they had fought.'\n\n'Old Oak was skilled indeed. It was a mere root then, but he cultivated it into the Verno Woods we see now.'\n\nThrough chatting with Baldum after the battle, people finally learned more about his tragic past. The 'Old Oak' he mentioned was, in fact, the Ancient Treefolk who brought the Verno Woods to life. He brought to Baldum not only a gift from the Yggdrasil but also a request: for him to head towards the glacial wildlands to the north of the Moonlight Plains and stand guard over the Abyssal Fissure near the foot of the sacred Mt. Orpheus.\n\nThat was how Baldum spent the past thousand years all alone, in the abandoned wildlands, desolate and friendless. At one point, he nearly forgot that he was once a warrior. With the memory buried deep, he simply sat there, reminiscing about the good old days when he and his clan members ran around, laughing, under the orange sunsets. But as soon as the Lokheim showed signs of abnormal activity and the flames of war neared his homeland, the born warrior immediately regained the battle instincts that ran deep in his blood.\n\n'I’ve been to many funerals in my life too many, but that was the most lonely one. No clan members ran at my side, no clan members sang the dirge with me. The whistling wind was my only companion. That, and the Cosmic Totem in my arms.' ",

Even Volkath, a captive of Edras, put aside his prejudice and hate for the Veda to pursue a romance with Marja.\n\nBrave and cunning, Volkath could do no wrong in Marja’s eyes. Though everyone was mortified by this union, the two fell deeply in love. However, they were blessed by none and doomed to split, for their backgrounds clashed and their ideals were in complete contradiction. After a public fallout between Volkath and Edras, poor Marja was in a dilemma. Her master, should she stand by her master, who stood for all of her beliefs, or her lover? There was no way she could choose.\n\nThe Veda expected all of its members to stand together against their common enemy, leaving everyone displeased to see Marja sitting on the fence. Though Edras understood and supported Marja’s concerns, the others treated her as a traitor. Marja was a stubborn girl, however, and did not back down despite the controversy. Instead, it only made her more convinced that she was not in any way at fault.\n\nThe war continued for a thousand years until Edras fell and Volkath retreated, injured. Marja was now hated by all in the Veda. She was no longer considered Edras’ successor, and was instead fingered as the one who had worked with the enemy to bring about the great leader’s demise. ",

Marja herself admitted that it was so. ‘I did help Volkath, but that was before the war began,’ she explained. ‘This doesn’t mean that I’m against the Veda—I just supported his beliefs. Never did I give him any aid when he was fighting Master Edras.\n\nThe enraged crowds did not let her finish her speech. The verdict was out immediately, and Marja would be punished by the hands of Ilumia, the new Seer.\n\nYour title, your powers, all will be taken from you. You will spend the pitiful remainder of your life slowly being devoured by bugs in your dark, cold cell. So, that’s the price you must pay for love, huh? How sweet! I’m so jealous!’ Ilumia cackled, finally able to get her much-desired revenge, for she, centuries before, had also loved Volkath from afar, yet her love had always been unrequited.\n\nMarja did not deign to reply to Ilumia’s snide remarks, considering it pointless to pick a fight now. Unable to get a rise out of her, Ilumia left with a disappointed shrug. The shadow worms in the Phantom Pit, however, were getting ready for the time of their lives. Marja, with her boundless angst, would taste so good! But Marja also looked a bit creepy. Dare they come close to her?\n\n'Eat away, eat away! I won’t be able to escape this prison unless you guys are well-fed,' Marja said, comforting the terrified shadow worms. ",

He climbed the ranks swiftly, and was soon awarded a General position by the Federal Council. Life did not remain peaceful, however. The conflict between the Federation and the Verno Woods escalated and Tamuq, a small town unfortunately located smack on the border, became the ideal location for both factions to duke it out.\n\nArum could be thoughtful and understanding when she wanted to, and she knew how much pressure her father was under. But how could she throw away her love for the Verno Woods, where she met and saved sweet little Leo, and the guardian pact she had sealed with the spirit beasts of the Lion Clan, just to support her father? Many had, in fact, shown hostility towards Arum because of her extraordinary past and fence sitting position people are extra sensitive nowadays after all. If not for Varian’s unblemished reputation, perhaps Arum would have already been thrown into jail for colluding with the enemy. ",

Once wed to Rahms, Arum would gain all immunities exclusive to the nobility and could no longer be targeted by the public’s accusations. This would give her a safer and brighter future, even if Rahms wasn’t exactly the nicest and most blameless man out there.\n\nHowever, now that Arum has ran away, Varian’s elaborate plans have gone to waste and the townspeople were rapidly losing their trust in him. They believed he orchestrated this in order to give his daughter the opportunity to flee into the Verno Woods. “Shameless traitor,” the enraged townies cried. They finally decide to imprison Varian, who was burdened with too much guilt to try and justify his actions.\n\nArum was distressed too distressed. In the end she snuck back to town and returned home to find that her father was no longer there only guards awaited, faces impassive. After learning her father has been sent to prison, Arum surrendered under one condition: that she was to be placed in the same cell as her father. The guards ended up letting her have her way, as she was, after all, the daughter of the once highly esteemed Varian. ",

This was the first time she has ever summoned her powers, limitless powers she had inherited from the spirit beasts. Her whole demeanor changed. Out of the void, savage spirit beasts appeared at her feet, radiating danger, dark gazes piercing. Varian had long known his daughter’s ties with the Woods, but never did he realize that she was capable of controlling such incredible, mystic powers.\n\nWithin a few seconds, all powers bestowed by the spirit beasts had manifested on Arum, making her the new Guardian of the Lions. Arum was now a member of the Woods, and therefore no longer a human. Arum had never attempted to activate her powers, not knowing how to explain them to her father, but drastic times call for drastic measures.

In an effort to gain more knowledge, Mganga planned to enslave the strongest of beasts, and trade them with the demons in exchange for powerful black magic. The priests of his tribe caught wind of this wicked plan, and knew they had to intervene. With their powers combined, they finally put a stop to his evil plans.\n\nMganga, always the one to hold a grudge, plotted mercilessly against the priests for their tampering. The priests, seen as the divine light of the tribe, were hung from trees or slaughtered in their own caves... Overnight, the tribe was placed in serious peril. However, it appeared that Mganga's madness had pushed the powers of righteousness too far, and they mounted a counterattack against him.\n\nThey swarmed him relentlessly, leaving him no choice but to retreat to the deepest parts of Dead Jungle. There, he took refuge amongst the venomous serpents and poisonous marshes. This by no means ended his study of black magic. On the contrary, he used his knowledge to communicate with dark forces, and now his mastery of black magic is greater than ever. ",

Even the undefeated Peerless Warlord, Lu Bu, paid his respects to Zanis. 'The swing of his spear is like that of a dragon: both furious and graceful. True fear is reflected in the eyes of his enemies when they face the spear in action.' His Prowess  in battles and tactical brilliance could not be denied by any, not even his greatest enemies.\n\n'I'm not a fighter,'\n\nZanis once whispered. Even the wise Zhuge Liang, nicknamed the Crouching Dragon, noticed Zanis was growing weary of the battles. Zhuge Liang could not let Zanis' potential go to waste, so he continued appointing Zanis tasks and missions, leaving him no time to second-guess himself. Regardless of Zanis' feelings towards combat, they never outweighed his loyalty to the emperor or the love for comrades. ",

He needed to devour souls to satisfy his constant hunger.\n\nTo stave off hunger during times of peace, he had to ask for help from Zephys and Nakroth; the former harvested souls while the latter past judgment. All guilty souls became his food. After the war broke out, in return for Grakk's strength, Maloch promised Grakk that he could do whatever he wanted with the enemies he captured.\n\nThe never-ending feast turned Grakk into a war maniac.

The chaos had not only changed Chaugnar's appearance, but also warped his mind. In his eyes, existence was merely a constant battle between chaos and order. Life, rules, logic, emotions, and faith meant nothing to him.\n\nAny unfortunate souls to come before this sinister being would cower when struck with a feeling more terrifying than the mere meaning of the term. If it hadn't been for a gifted human, who lured Chaugnar into a trap and sealed him in the depths of the Black Sea, this world would have been lost long ago.\n\nYet, the power of chaos could never be exterminated completely. All that a human could do is to fight to weaken Chaugnar, mitigating the threat he posed. However, everyone knew that Chaugnar would eventually break out from his shackles, and his fury would rain upon every corner of this world. ",

There was not a single trace of darkness in Yorn, for he was the embodiment of light.\n\nWhenever the forces of darkness begin to stir, Yorn would mount his steed and lead his army into battle. His divine bow would always be by his side, just as the sun's countless rays of light giving no quarter to darkness. His peerless abilities as an archer meant his arrow never misses its target. During battles, even Maloch himself would be wise to stay out of Yorn's sight to avoid falling victim to the Temple of Light's most powerful weapon. ",

However, such a peaceful life was not suitable for the restless Wukong, who always thought about his days of adventuring on the Silk Road.\n\nWukong had travelled thousands and thousands of miles by foot, and survived 81 tribulations. With the staff in hand, he defeated countless fierce monsters, increasing the body count along the way to the West. Wukong was newer warm-hearted or well behaved. Had he not been on Gautama Buddha’s leash, he would have gotten into fights every day, even after becoming a god.\n\nWhen the crisis of Athanor spread to Pürva-videha, Wukong knew that it was the chance he had been waiting for. Pretending to investigate the crisis, Wukong volunteered to head for Athanor, where he returned to his old self, alerting all heroes to his presence.\n\nAs divinity tends to attract one another, Ilumia the Seer was the first to converse with Wukong. By her invitation, Wukong became one of the members of the Holy Hall and enjoyed the donations with the other deities. Ilumia promised that Wukong would not be bound by rules as long as he did no harm to Vedä. In other words, Wukong could battle any enemy hero at any time. ",

Under their influences, Wisp became a tinkerer of machines at a very young age, eventually she became known as the ‘Demolition Expert of the Lab’.\n\n‘Don’t worry, it’s just wear and tear,’ Moren always comforted Wisp with these kind words to encourage her to keep exploring. She believed him and carried on with her experiments, but at the expense of Max, who worked in the same lab and had to put up with mysterious explosions, shock waves and the mess that Wisp left behind…\n\n‘Don’t worry, it’s just wear and tear,’ Wisp would comfort Max with those very same words.\n\nIn less than two years, she found herself calling in bombs, which meant that she had to move into the mountainous areas with less residents to carry out advanced experiments. Naturally, Max was very happy about this arrangement, because it meant he would be free from the nightmare that is his sister. But being the big brother, he was still worried about her moving out, so he built her the ‘Destructor’, a mechanical transport that was deadly.‘Thank you, bro!’ Wisp immediately climbed into the cockpit, but The Destructor came to a halt after a series of grinding noises.\n\nWisp scowled,’What was that? Did you build me something defective?’ ‘It was just an accident!’ Max replied, but he was really thinking, ‘Well, you touched it, so it broke down.’\n\n‘Actually, you are now an extraordinary tinkerer, so you should fix it yourself,’ Moren finally spoke up.\n\n‘A piece of cake!’ Wisp complied, slid down from the Destructor and grabbed the wrench from Max.\n\nSoon, Wisp and a functioning Destructor were on their way ",

The abilities of these new vampires were unorthodox yet advanced: their offensive strategies involved the casting of spells to produce fireballs and lightning. Some had the ability of flight as well. The Princes' abilities provided them with great advantages not easily overpowered. Only the likes of Violet, who had undergone extensive training, could rival these unnatural forces and their magic.\n\nThe more Princes she killed, the more of a threat she became, and the more her name was known throughout the Princes' ranks. Their collectively seething hatred for Violet amplified their desires to destroy her. It motivated them to commit immense amount of efforts to launch long-distance attacks on her army.\n\nHer most powerful weapon was her personal firearm, the Rose of Fate, which won countless battles for her; unfortunately, It was destroyed by a fireball. Violet immediately became weaker and her army began to falter. This enraged her. She vowed to defeat them at all costs, not allowing the loss of her weapon to prevent that from ever happening.\n\n'If vampires feed on humans, then we shall feed on the vampires!' ",

This changed while traveling to Romania to claim an inheritance left for him. The journey robbed Valhein of the possibility of a normal life. Helpless and horrified, Valhein could do nothing as Dracula abducted and murdered his wife. His world shattered, Valhein swore vengeance upon the nosferatu and his entire species!\n\n'I hereby swear in the name of God that I shall defeat all the dark powers lurking within the shadows. I will battle the vampire scourge until my last breath!' A man possessed, this solemn vow became his singular driving force.\n\nValhein sought out vampires wherever they nested, and one by one he slew each and every one of them. When the last had crumbled to dust at his feet, Valhein felt a sudden and certain emptiness. An ethereal voice called out to him 'You have dared to do what few mortals in history could have done. You have fought back against the creatures of night and triumphed. Yet darkness takes on many forms, vampires were but one of many.' As the voice spoke, Valhein felt himself renewed. It continued, 'Please lend aid, there are other terrors, demons which only you are capable of vanquishing.' ",

The only thing cared about was instilling the fury of killing in all sea creatures. As for what they killed, well, that was up to them.\n\nRelentless slaughter served as the source of power of Kil'Groth's rage. Fresh blood diffusing into the seas aroused swarms upon swarms of deep sea predators which then filled the gaps left in the food chain. Such intense rage power was intoxicating for the demons.\n\nTaara, commander of the Fallen, wielded her hammer like the coming of a cyclone. She used the power of absolute zero ice to freeze the ocean surface. The water, which was heated by fresh blood, cooled and even Kil’Groth felt the effects. His pride, however, did not allow him to flee a fight. His raging will blazed and freed Kil’Groth from his icy confines. He picked up his massive sea blade and began his last charge towards the intruder.\n\nMany hundreds died at Kil’Groth’s hands, but, under the command of Taara, the flood of the Fallen drowned him like a massive tidal wave. When the bloody battle ended, the dying Kil’Groth lacked the strength to even hold his weapon. In fact, if Cresht hadn’t led the beast army to the rescue, Kil’Groth may have died there and become a legend in his own right.\n\nHowever, Kil’Groth recovered from his wounds and ended up joining the Forest of Shadows array to show his gratitude as well as exact revenge.

After war broke out, Slimz recognized a business opportunity and persuaded the arms specialist Moen to build a Castle of Alchemy in the border lands. This castle would serve as a continuous supply of weapons and equipment to warring men, beasts, or anything else that could pay the price. After all, Slimz was a trader and neutral in the matter.\n\nBusiness boomed for Slimz and he accumulated an astounding fortune, yet the scope of the war grew larger and larger. To protect his wealth and the flow of his business, Slimz had the foresight to build a private army that comprised of wild beasts, men and alchemy puppets. Unfortunately for Slimz, it was Preyta, the supreme commander of the Fallen, who was the first to go after his wealth. Slimz fought tooth and nail and even enlisted the support of Omega, the Awoken Mech for support, but he was unable to save the Castle of Alchemy from its ultimate fate. His wealth, which took him many years to accumulate, was lost in a single night.\n\nHungry to regain his wealth and status, Slimz returned to the Forest of Shadows and entered a new agreement with Tel'Annas, the Queen of Spirits: The agreement stated that the queen would mobilize forces to retake the Castle of Alchemy, while Slimz remained in the Forest of Shadows and protected it in her absence.

Therefore, everyone, from the mightiest of Gods to the most despicable of demons, holds him in high regard. This also meant that Moren was able to maintain a neutral position and, remain above it all, for a very long time.\n\nSlimz the Trustworthy sensed a new business opportunity in Moren's weapon forging abilities. After haggling over the price, the two eventually signed a lifetime contract. From then on, Slimz had complete ownership of all weapons created by Moren. In return, Moren received several precious mechanical diagrams, an endless supply of materials, and the Castle of Alchemy. This partnership made both parties extremely wealthy, but it also made them the new target of the Army of the Fallen.\n\nFollowing a joint assault by Preyta and Skud, the Castle of Alchemy suffered a devastating defeat. Slimz hoped to retain at least some influence, but he had nothing left to bargain with, and could not persuade the stubborn Moren to stop resisting. He had no choice but to terminate the contract and make Moren a free agent again. Following this, Moren deployed his few remaining weapons at the castle and launched a final attack.\n\nMoren's actions enraged Skud who, annihilated the castle's defenses and all but destroyed Omega.Moren, who was seriously injured, attempted to detonate an incendiary bomb that would have taken Skud down with him. However, Omega dragged him to safety before he could detonate the bomb. Eventually, he followed Omega's advice and accepted a proposal by Thane, the human commander. ",

Luna, her sister, outshone her in every way. She was talented, smart, beautiful, and held in high regard by their peers. Meanwhile, Lindis merely stood in her shadow. Their bond was incredibly strong, and as time passed, the two sisters developed a psychic connection with one another. Lindis was content just being Luna's little sister.\n\nSadly, that heartfelt wish would soon be dashed. Mganga the Unspeakable had quietly maneuvered his way into the tribe. He began to work his charm on Lindis.\n\nJust as he was prepared to start siphoning away Landis' power, Luna, sensing her sister's predicament, came to the rescue. Yet, she was not powerful enough to defeat Mganga alone. As Lind is returned to her senses, she was overcome with both guilt and despair. ‘I'll take both your powers!’ Mganga exclaimed with delight and avarice.\n\n'I won't dare let you!' shouted Luna. And with all her might, Luna released a bright burst of energy that drew out the full power in both sisters, melding their souls together inextricably. ‘You... What have you done?! You would sacrifice your own life and existence for her?!’\n\nUnder the light of the silver moon, Luna grew ever weaker while her energy brought Lindis back from the brink of death. ‘Lindis, I'm so proud of you,’ was all that was said before Lana's physical presence faded, signaling the completion of their union. Lindis fired a deadly arrow from her crossbow towards Mganga. Badly wounded and defeated, Mganga fled and never returned. ",

Before his exceptionality came into play, speediness had been overlooked for centuries because human and beasts alike praised characteristics such as strength and wisdom. until. Despite these traditionally upheld characteristics, Fennik changed the game when his speed eventually became a threat.\n\nNow, not only was speediness praised, but it was also feared. Speediness became a huge advantage not only in battles, but also in everyday life. With his speed as his weapon, theft became nothing more than a hobby to Fennik. Of all the thieves, he has yet to be caught and holds the highest bounty in the continent.\n\nThere were only two instances in which Fennik was relevant and known universally by humans and beasts: he either raided their belongings or he made them worry about the moment when he would. The only people who did not condone Fennik's habits were those who were benefited from them. Those who were victims of his theft and those who were rewarded were not arbitrary, Fennik unintentionally tried to find a middle-ground between the fortunate and the less fortunate.\n\nNothing pleased him more than seeing the chagrin on the faces of his wealthy victims who he had just stolen from and the gratitude on the faces of the less-fortunate when receiving unexpected gifts. Fennik embodied a childlike spirit and embraced the art of tomfoolery. Money was merely an objective, his priorities laid deeper within.\n\nWhat is life? Being happy of course! ",

The thunder Tulen created was a thousand times stronger than regular magic. Some would call it godlike.\n\nYet, the sly Aleister did not take a liking to Tulen. He sensed that Tulen would one day take his place, and thus decided he would leave Tulen nothing, not a single spell. Unfortunately, for Aleister, this method of teaching worked in Tulen’s favor. His innate ability to control thunder allowed him to harness his powers without spells. While his vivid imagination propelled his powers to even greater heights.\n\nTulen’s success sent Aleister into a spiral that would eventually lead to his downfall. Tulen was not blind to his teacher’s ploy, however. He had no intention of taking Aleister’s place. Far from it. Yet, he also had no intention of giving anyone else the throne of thunder. He wanted the absolute freedom Aleister had…something a pupil like him would have great difficulties achieving.\n\nFinally, Tulen descended upon the temple with his godlike thunder and wiped away his teacher’s sigil, burning his own upon the throne before stunned eyes. In so doing, he proved that he not only had the strength to take Aleister’s place, but the throne of thunder had already chosen him. Then, under Ilumia’s guidance, Tulen successfully ascended the throne of thunder.\n\nHis first task was to recapture the throne’s previous owner – his own teacher, Aleister, for without Aleister, Tulen only held the title without the power.

It will be useful when you are chasing down targets and kiting around an enemy target. No one actually uses this Talent as a main choice for any heroes.\n\n**Execute (Unlock at Level 3)**\n\n*90-second cooldown:* Instantly attacks a nearby enemy hero and deals damage equal to 16% of the HP the enemy hero has lost as true damage.\n\nExecute is one of a good early account levels Talent. It is very useful especially in lane where you could try and cheese the enemies. Execute are usually taken by high damage assassins or warriors. Don’t use them when the enemy health points are still high, only use Execute when they are around 10%-20% health which would maximizes the true damage dealt. Don’t let the text fool you! It actually deals damage to all enemies’ hero in the area instead of one.\n\n**Punish (Unlock at Level 5)**\n\n*30-second cooldown:* Deals 800 true damage to nearby minions and monsters and stun them for 1 second.\n\nPunish is usually a jungler’s Talent. Every jungler needs Punish to clear the camps quicker and secures it. It’s also very crucial when it comes to a crossfire between Dark Slayer/Abyssal Dragon and the enemy team, where you could try and use Punish to secure the objective. Also, it can be upgraded to Frostbite Talent by purchasing Tier 2 Jungle Items. Frostbite can deal true damage on enemies’ hero and reduces their movement speed.\n\nSource: [MobileGamerHub](https://mobilegamerhub.com/arena-of-valor/talent-guide/) ",

Thus, you would sacrifice a lot of survivability by not taking defensive Talent. A bad choice, no one actually uses this Talent.\n\n**Heal (Unlock at Level 9)**\n\n*120-second cooldown:* You and nearby teammates instantly recover 15% HP and gain 15% movement speed for 2 seconds.\n\nHeal is actually a very good Talent to be taken by tanks and supports. It heals 15% of the health in a radius and most important it can stack among your team! Which means if your team has 3 heals, they can be used together to heal a total of 45% HP. Definitely a great Talent.\n\n**Disrupt (Unlock at Level 11)**\n\n*60-second cooldown:* Silences a structure for 5 seconds.\n\nA decent Talent to take for diving and taking down towers. Otherwise, it’s pretty useless in teamfights where you couldn’t take any advantage from the Talent. Only taken by supports and tanks.\n\n**Daze (Unlock at Level 13)**\n\n*90-second cooldown:* Stuns nearby enemies for 0.5 seconds, then reduces their movement speed for 1 second.\n\nBad Talent, period. The stun and movement speed reduction are unreliable and unnoticeable. Long cooldown as well. You are better off by choosing some other Talent.\n\nSource: [MobileGamerHub](https://mobilegamerhub.com/arena-of-valor/talent-guide/) ",

Their abilities are played around with crowd controls and staying in the front line to preventing them from charging into your team while soaking a lot of damage for your teammates.\n\n**Warrior** – These are the semi-tank damage dealers. They do decent amount of damage but while still staying on the front line. Dealing as much as damage you can to the enemy front lines, try to breach into the back lines.\n\n**Assassin** – They have the highest burst damage in game, they have patience and they wait for an opportunity to seize an opportunity. Assassins are there to destroy the enemy back lines by sneaking into it. They are very versatile and mobile.\n\n**Mage** – One of the backline composition. The mages would be spamming abilities and deal a lot of magical damage in the back while your front lines are protecting you.\n\n**Marksman** – These heroes are long ranged and they rely on basic attacks to deal a lot of physical damage. Marksman hit anyone they can in the teamfight and plays really safe with your teammates in the front protecting you.\n\n**Support** – These heroes focused more on the ally than the enemies. Your goal and objective is to protect your team carries at all cost, helping them to peel and kite from the enemies assassins or warriors.\n\nSource: [MobileGamerHub](https://mobilegamerhub.com/arena-of-valor/heroes-guide/) ",

Every players start the game with a total of six inventory slots, each player can only obtain up to six items at a time. Items play a huge part of the game which defines a hero strength, which is why it’s very important to farm gold and get the core items. Players can purchase their items in the Shop by spending gold. \n\nThere will be four categories to differentiate the items, such as:\n\n**Core Items** – These items are the most important items to a specific hero. It scales really well with the hero and does a lot better than any other items. There will be no replacement that can substitute the Core Items without losing any strength.\n\n**Situational Items** – Mostly defensive items, these items are bought based on the current gameplay. For example, enemy has too many magic damage, it’s recommended to purchase magic resist items.\n\n**Bad Items** – Naturally, they are not bad items. It’s just that every other items outscales this item and beat it to the very best. There is literally no reason to purchase these items on a specific hero unless you are ready to lose games.\n\n**Boots** – Every hero need a boot. It increases your movement speed which is very important to make a move. Be aware, Boots do not stack so you can only have one boot at a time.\n\nSource: [MobileGamerHub](https://mobilegamerhub.com/arena-of-valor/item-guide/) ",

Let them know that you are on the way to gank so they could follow up at an appropriate speed.\n\n**Watch the jungle!** – There are many aggressive junglers in the game who might steal your team’s jungle monsters in the early game.

Top and Bot lanes are typically duo lanes, meaning at least two heroes will be in either of these lanes unless a player decides to Jungle. You won’t see many people jungling when you first start the game but as you advance, you will notice an increase of jungle players.\n\nWhich will leave you with 2 solo lanes, and a duo lane. Mid lane is always a solo lane. Bot lane is usually a duo lane, even when there is a Jungler. The Jungle is the area in between each of the lanes, where there are several monster camps, as well as buffs and major objectives for each team.\n\nWhich lane you should go to depends on your champion, and then your desired outcome. Mages or a long-range characters typically take the mid lane. You can occasionally get away with going in another lane if up you aren’t completely comfortable being in the solo lane just make sure your team has an adequate replacement for mid.\n\nADCs, warriors and tanks/bruisers will often be found in the top or bottom lanes, also known as the side lanes. Assassin heroes may occasionally be in one of these lanes due to a players preference and play style. But more often than not they will be in the jungle. Which will be covered below.\n\nSource: [MobileGamerHub](https://mobilegamerhub.com/arena-of-valor/newbie-objective-tutorial/) ",

The blue buff monster provides a 2% mana regen and 20% cooldown reduction for its killer.\n\nThe Red buff monster provides a movement speed reduction to targets hit, and a damage over time burn, which provides an excellent way to keep enemies from escaping. These monsters are tethered to their spawning area, so you can’t pull them all around the map, stay within the range indicator going from Green-Yellow-Red, once it reaches red you are in danger of resetting the mob back to full health.\n\nThere is also tiny ghost-like dragons in the river that can be killed, that will send out an orb to give vision within the enemies jungle. This is worth killing anytime you see it, and it can also be killed by anyone in a lane. Definitely, recommend killing this when you are waiting for creeps in your lane, and you can’t rotate to another objective.\n\nSource: [MobileGamerHub](https://mobilegamerhub.com/arena-of-valor/newbie-objective-tutorial/) ",

Constantly watching the minimap will keep you from being ganked or give you an idea of when you’re free to push on a lane or you’re free to go after a jungle objective uncontested.\n\nFor the early game, try to push the enemy out of lane, it doesn’t matter if you don’t kill them, just force them to recall. Once they do, fast push your wave, apply damage to the tower and then reset once they come back. You can also dip into the nearby jungle camps for additional gold and XP.\n\nBe careful if you’re doing this at low health, this is when you are likely to be surprised by a jungler or a highly mobile hero who was watching the fight. Once you take down your first tower, start looking at the next objective you can get. Try to kill the Dragon once you’re within the appropriate level ranges or group with your teammates and help them kill the enemy, and take down their tower.\n\nSource: [MobileGamerHub](https://mobilegamerhub.com/arena-of-valor/newbie-objective-tutorial/) ",

If you have encountered such issue, advice your teammates to follow-up with the team composition and pick a better role. Each team need at least 2-3 front lines so the entire team doesn’t get shut down in a few seconds.\n\n**Basic Team Composition:** This team composition is formed based on most MOBA games such as League of Legends. They have a solo laner (Dark Slayer), Mid laner, Duo-Lane (Marksman and Support Abyssal Dragon) and a Jungler. It’s fine to have such composition but the support has to roam a lot in order to let the marksman farm better and faster. It’s very common in solo-queue games because the lack of communication.\n\n**Roamer Composition:** Consists of three solo laners (Dark Slayer, Abyssal Dragon and Mid lane), a roamer and a jungler. The good thing about this composition is because three players get to solo their lane and gain the highest gold possible from the minion waves. The roamer should be a high-based damage or with decent crowd control such as Ormarr, Thane, Mina and Skud. The roamer’s job is to pressure the enemy junglers and also the laners while protecting your jungler to farm in peace. They could even set up a gank with the jungler to have a 3-man tower dive. Your ally jungler should be a late gamer that can snowballs well and carry games such as Violet and Slimz. It’s very common in a 2-3 man queue games. Since the nerf of Soulreaver <:soulreaver90x90:421477043440451584> , there would be lesser Marksman in the jungle.\n\nSource: [MobileGamerHub](https://mobilegamerhub.com/arena-of-valor/pre-match-heroes-selection/) ",

It requires really good team communication so that no one gets sloppy and letting the enemy assassins destroying your backlines. Mina or Thane + Chaugnar are usually played to peel for the marksman even better.\n\n**No Marksman Composition:** Also known as a 'diving composition'. Relies on 2-3 powerful fighters/assassins to deal damage while ignoring the enemy tanks in teamfight. The goal is to destroy the enemies’ backlines and the frontlines next. There would be no marksman in the team so it’s not required to peel for the backlines. There are some reliable picks that doesn’t need peeling such as Lauriel, Tulen and sometimes Joker.

Many players has been going into the middle lane just to look for 1v1 and show dominance that they are better but without realizing every other lanes in their team are collapsing. Without the pressure of a mid laner, the team can be vulnerable to the enemies. The thing that the other laners couldn’t do are the amount of pressure that can be provided and contributed by the mid laner.\n\nAs a mid laner, you can control the middle lane and influence the rest of the game. No matter how aggressive or defensive you are, it’s important to know how to control the mid lane and control the game. The difficulty of a mid laner isn’t just because of the 1v1 and skill-match up, it’s more about rotating and taking advantages to help securing a victory for you and your team.\n\nSource: [MobileGamerHub](https://mobilegamerhub.com/arena-of-valor/how-to-play-the-mid-lane/) ",

	          "description": "There are so many different type of heroes in Arena of Valor but not all of them are suitable for being a mid laner. How do you know if a hero is suitable for the mid lane? It’s simple. Any hero (such as Mages, but never marksmen) that has decent crowd controls, mobility,good base damage, long ranged abilities to clear minion wave and can scale well into the mid or late game. Why? As a melee hero, it’s not very effective as most enemy mid laners are ranged type hero, you would get harassed, poked and pushed into the tower range which ruin the entire pressure of the mid lane. It would give advantage for the enemies to roam and gank your teammates. Thus, you will have to go outside the tower range further than a ranged hero does, which might put yourself very vulnerable to ganks from either the top or bottom side.\n\nPlaying heroes with less complex and difficulty will give you the opportunities to carry the game easier. Some heroes are really hard to play which takes time to master it completely, you would not bring the full potential of that hero. The thing about MOBA games is “there are always meta picks”. Every major patch, some heroes get nerfed and buffed accordingly. Some of the heroes are the “best” picks and some are the “worst” picks in the mid lane. It’s important to have understanding of the meta if you are aiming to climb the ranks. It would be highly recommended to master/main at least 2-3 heroes for a lane or role.\n\nSource: [MobileGamerHub](https://mobilegamerhub.com/arena-of-valor/how-to-play-the-mid-lane/) ",

It’s important to know the patterns of the enemies’ abilities such as their range, damage, etc. and you can even harass the enemy without taking damage. Why you should trade and harass? Whenever you won in a trade, the enemies has to back off into their Altar of Life to regenerate their health. At this point, you can look for opportunity to gank, taking objectives or taking the tower down. If they don’t back off, it could be an easy kill for you and your team.\n\n**All-In**\n\nWhat is All-In? – Using every abilities and spells available to burst their health down, trying to get a kill or make them low enough for them to back off.

A jungler play a major part in a standard 5v5 game, they could affect the early game into your favor or the enemies based on how you play it. Firstly, if you want to be a good jungler, you will need to understand the basics. Jungling is not just about killing the neutral monsters in the jungle and ganking, there is more to it. Being a jungler has to have map presence for your team. A jungler starts by clearing the jungle camps, gain level advantage over the laners and take advantage by ganking or securing objectives.\n\nAs a jungler, your Talent would be Punish at all times, there is no exception because Punish is needed to clear the jungle quicker, securing objectives and the ability to purchase Jungle Items which gain bonus experience by killing the jungle monsters.\n\nSource: [MobileGamerHub](https://mobilegamerhub.com/arena-of-valor/how-to-play-the-mid-lane/) ",

Don’t ever start with the smaller jungle camps because you would not reach Level 2 by killing them first which will slow down your jungling speed. Clear the entire jungle camp afterwards to reach Level 4 which unlocks your heroes’ ultimate as soon as possible.

Don’t bother ganking if your allies minion are pushed into the enemy tower range, it would be impossible unless the enemy hero is low enough to dive. Look for vulnerable targets that are out of positioning, Try not to waste too much time by waiting in the bushes for a perfect gank. You should always check the lane before reaching to know if you could set-up a gank. Always communicate with your team, telling them that you are on your way to gank by using the quick chat. It’s important to know how most laning matchups go so that you can prioritize which lanes are the easiest to gank or require an early gank to decide the matchup. Whenever possible, walk up to the enemy hero during a gank and save your gap-closer/mobility abilities for after, when they use their escape abilities. Also, by having Tier 2 Jungle Items, your Punish ability would be transformed into Frostbite that can slow enemy heroes which help in ganking.\n\nIt’s also important to understand the situation before actually ganking:\n\n~How much health does your laner and enemy laner has? Are your ally healthy enough to aid you?\n\n~What hero are you, your allies and enemies using? You can’t expect to have a successful gank if your ally laner has no damage or crowd control versus an enemy hero that has lots of mobility unless your team could bait their abilities into cooldown.\n\n~Where are the enemy jungler? Can I win a clash if the enemy jungle appear to counter-gank? or am I fast enough to destroy the enemy laner with your team before the enemy jungler arrive?\n\nSource: [MobileGamerHub](https://mobilegamerhub.com/arena-of-valor/how-to-play-the-mid-lane/) ",

	          "description": "**C) Controlling**\n\nControlling the jungle could pressure the enemy jungler from farming safely and pressures the entire enemy team. A jungler can do that by counter-jungling. By predicting or knowing where the enemy jungle could be, as a jungler, you can steal the enemy jungle monsters which would impact their item powerspikes by slowing them down. For example, the enemy jungler showed up at the Dark Slayer/Top Lane, you could always check if there is any jungle monsters in Abyssal Dragon side, stealing their Buff Golems would be changing the jungling pace. The safest way is when the enemy jungler showed up on the other side, then you will have to worry about the enemy laners. Although, it can be really dangerous to counter-jungle at times especially when you have been spotted by the enemies. If you are new to jungle, I don’t suggest counter-jungling.\n\nNow, you don’t just want to control the jungle but also the laners which comes to a term called “Counter-Ganking”. Counter-ganking means that you gank a lane while the enemy jungler is ganking it. You could save your ally teammate or get a kill or two for your team. It’s effective because the enemies would not expect for you to come. You and your teammate can focus on the enemy target that is easier to kill and rotate into the next target if possible.\n\nSometimes, you could even look after the enemies in the jungle and gank them with or without your team. This can be really effective on some strong early game heroes such as Batman that could bring down the enemy jungler easily. It could be really game-changing when you have succeeded.\n\nSource: [MobileGamerHub](https://mobilegamerhub.com/arena-of-valor/how-to-play-the-mid-lane/) ",

It could be ganking and killing the enemy heroes, counter-jungling or taking objectives such as Abyssal Dragon, Spirit Sentinel and Towers. Taking objectives is very important because it could provide a gold and/or experience advantage to the team that controls it which is why there is always competition to fight for it. You should have your Talent – Punish readied to secure them.\n\n**When should I take the objectives?**\n\nA bad call for your team could lead into a great disadvantage. The safest way to secure the objectives is when your team has more members against the enemies in the objective area. Such as:\n\n~The enemy jungler is attempting to gank your Laner on the other side.\n\n~You have successfully ganked and killed the enemy heroes.\n\n~The enemies are low on health, which forces them to recall back to the Altar of Life.\n\n~When your team is ahead, which forces the enemy to back off or die along with the objective.\n\nSometimes, you could even sneak and kill the Abyssal Dragon or Spirit Sentinel alone or with your team quickly before your enemy knows. On the other hand, taking Towers are harder because the enemies can kill your minion wave easily and prevent your team from taking it down. Never try to solo the Dark Slayer unless you are a really fed carry with crazy lifesteals which is very unlikely to happen. When your team has successfully taken down the Dark Slayer, take advantage of it. Force a teamfight when possible, take down as much tower as your team can.\n\nSource: [MobileGamerHub](https://mobilegamerhub.com/arena-of-valor/how-to-play-the-mid-lane/) ",

As a DS laner, it is required to have great map sense and decision making. There are two type of DS laners in the game and their gameplay are different than the others. They are the Split-Pusher/Carry and Teamfighter/Tank. I’ll be explaining more on what’s their goal and objective below.\n\nPlaying in the DS Lane, your goal is to win against your enemy laner, if you do, that is a great advantage for your team. Now, how do you win against the enemy laner? By winning, it is not necessary to solo kill the enemy in a 1v1 situation. It’s all about pressuring the Dark Slayer side of the lane and jungle or securing/stealing enemy jungle camp as much as possible, having gold advantage over the enemy laner.\n\nSource: [MobileGamerHub](https://mobilegamerhub.com/arena-of-valor/how-to-play-dark-slayer-top-lane/) ",

Their item path are usually damage items with some tanky items which makes them hard to kill while doing ridiculous amount of damage. They are focused more into pressuring the DS Lane, zoning out the enemy laner and taking farms as much as possible. These heroes requires item and gold lead to be effective. If the enemy laner has gone missing or recalled back to Altar of Life to recover, they can push towers really quickly and when it is destroyed, the Dark Slayer side would be really dangerous for the enemy to farm peacefully.\n\nIt is required to play as aggressive as possible unless you know you are losing. It would be a huge advantage if you could dominate the entire lane and pressure DS side of the map. These heroes usually take Punish or Execute as their talent.\n\nExecute – Aggressive playstyle, cheesing strategy.\nPunish – A little safer side, securing Vision Wraith/Spirit Dragon and stealing enemy jungle when the entire enemy team is on the other side and you can’t reach there in time. Also for the Jungle Items, some jungle items are really strong on some specific heroes.\n \n\nSource: [MobileGamerHub](https://mobilegamerhub.com/arena-of-valor/how-to-play-dark-slayer-top-lane/) ",

Unlike Split-Pusher or Carry, in the laning phase they have to play safe and wait for a gank. If the enemies has Punish and you don’t, it’s hard to secure the Vision Wraith. They will fall behind in gold if against an enemy hero with Punish but these heroes are strong naturally, building tanky items would make them really hard to kill meanwhile their damage are still debatable.\n\nThese heroes are not good at split-pushing (except Xeniel) because their basic attacks are slow and lower damage than the others. It’s better to follow-up and roam with your team whenever they need help.

It’s about showing who’s the boss and pressuring them for your allies to secure objectives. Always be prepared to rotate when your team is planning to take down the Abyssal Dragon. If you start dying too much, change your playstyle and play less aggressively.\n\nLet’s say if you have successfully taken down the first tower in the Dark Slayer lane. Don’t stay in the same lane and overextend all the way into the second tower! It’s time to roam and help your allies to siege the other towers. If you are losing the lane by just trading with each other, don’t repeat it. You will probably lose and risk yourself getting dived under tower.

The lookers-on sighed in relief. They were worried that their sunshine warrior would break down in grief, but it turned out he remained as optimistic as ever.\n\nIn accord to the laws set by Astrid, the Duchess of Rose, Rourke was granted a sprawling manor after his return from war. Thus, Rourke anonymously gifted the manor to the surviving relatives of one of his battle companions, and set off, carrying a recommendation letter from the Duchess, and landed the job of Captain in a foreign town near the borders.\n\nTo thank him for taking the position, the craftsmen of the Federation manufactured a mechanical crossbow to be fitted where Rourke's lost arm had once been. ‘This is my new home. I've bid farewell to my past, and found my new life,’ Rourke stated.\n\nThe townsmen adored the new Captain as well was not stuck-up like other officials, and was instead a constant source of happiness. He was, however, a warrior tried and true when performing his duties. After all, you can't keep order in your territory just by being happy, can you?\n\nWith the relationship between the Federation of the Free and the Verno Woods gradually improving and the promotion of the Chamber of Commerce, a ‘market road’ was established.

Although Marksmen have the ability to stay relatively safe by kiting their foes, they are very fragile and are extremely reliant on powerful item purchases & peeling from your teammates to become reliable damage threats. ADC stands for “Attack Damage Carry” which usually refer to a ranged hero who deals continuous damage with their basic attacks and scales with attack-related stats – i.e. attack damage , attack speed and critical strikes.\n\nUsually, a marksman goes into the Abyssal Dragon/Bot lane with a support (Duo Lane). The support can be roaming or staying in the bot lane to pressure the enemies and protect the marksman from any threats/gank while farming peacefully. Marksman is one of the hardest role to play because they are so squishy, any mistake can be a fatal one and costs you the entire game.\n\nA marksman have a few vital advantages over the other roles and playstyles. For beginners, marksmen are ranged which allows you to deal damage while being untouchable. However, marksman are too vulnerable to bruisers, fighters and assassins.\n\nSource: [MobileGamerHub](https://mobilegamerhub.com/arena-of-valor/how-to-play-marksman-abyssal-dragon-bot-lane/) ",

On a regular minion (melee/ranged minion) you can get a bonus of 10 gold +/- and last hit on the siege minion (balista) would give you a bonus of 30 gold +/-. Let’s say your enemies doesn’t last hit and you do, in a few minutes you would have a few hundred gold lead and you can finish your first core item than your opponent which makes you stronger in teamfights or an Abyssal Dragon contest.

Keep your eye on the surroundings of your hero, try to focus, understand and react. As a marksman, you should NEVER stay in the front lines. You should always stay in the back, providing strong damage per second (DPS) for your front lines. By understanding the game and every heroes in the game (knowing their range, damage, abilities and cooldown), you can react based on each heroes’ capabilities and knowing how much threat they could be to you.\n\nDon’t think what you are going to do next whenever in a teamfight. Think what your enemies are going to do next. For example, there is an assassin in the enemy team waiting for an opportunity to flank you. If you are the assassin, you would want to take down the strongest threat in the enemy team which is the marksman, if they aren’t paying attention, you can take him down and win the teamfight. Know what type of enemy heroes you are dealing with, understand their gameplay and react to prevent these scenarios from happening.\n\nYour main priority in the teamfight is to stay alive and dealing as much damage as possible. You should never walk into the front to focus on the enemy carries, leave that job to your team assassins or fighters.

Being a good marksman requires a good mentality thinking, blaming on your teammates or the hero are being in denial and you won’t improve if you don’t accept and learn from your mistakes. Sometimes it may be your teammates’ fault for not peeling, but you can also play differently.\n\n**2. Bottom Lane over Top Lane**\n\nSometimes, it’s just better to head into the Bot Lane (even if the Dark Slayer is at the bottom side) as a marksman. Why? Because it’s safer.\n\nYou have access into the bottom side jungle while farming it and being safe over the wall. You can take the vision monster over the wall meanwhile you have to go outside if you are at the top lane.\n\nDownside: You can’t help your team when it comes to Abyssal Dragon. But if the Abyssal Dragon is located at the bottom lane, it would be even better. 50/50 flip a coin.\n\n**3. Respect the enemies**\n\nIf the enemies has a lead, respect them. A lead can mean many things such as being ahead in gold, items, objectives and experiences. It’s more likely that you would lose in a 1v1 or 2v2. Sometimes you could even get ganked and dived under the tower. When it comes to this, it’s better to give up and give the tower to the enemies rather than staying in the tower in a 1v3 situation.

Correct item building**\n\nLearn what’s best item for every marksman available and buy them accordingly, it’s okay to purchase some defensive items if you are having problem with surviving. There is no point buying full damage items if you get assassinated before dealing any damage at all.\n\n**5. Being a carry**\n\nA “carry” does not mean that you have a lot of kills or dealing the highest damage for your team. It’s more like making the right decision, giving calls and knowing what to do in a certain situation. You need a playmaker/shotcaller in your team so everyone doesn’t go running around without any clue. If you can’t be the one to do so, find someone who can.\n\n**6. No marksman meta/team composition**\n\nDon’t worry too much about it. It can be hard to fight against a full-dive team composition where everyone just jump into you and burst you down but there are plenty of ways to win a game as a marksman. Start by playing more safe and scale into the mid or late game. The most common mistakes that people make is overextending and getting caught out of nowhere. Pay attention to the map and look which path you are heading. Your team support is your best friend and assassins/bushes are your enemies.

Even if an enemy carry are out of position in a teamfight, don’t chase it and risk the enemy assassins to burst you down. You might feel that you deal no damage to the enemy front line tanks but actually you are helping way lot more than you think. Attack the enemies at maximum range and walk around after each basic attack, it helps dodging certain abilities from the enemies.\n\n**8. Rely on your teammates, don’t go solo**\n\nTrust me, you will need your teammates more than ever. Have some faith and believe. You can’t handle the entire game alone. Let them know if you need peeling against the enemies, flaming or being toxic wouldn’t help at all.\n\n**9. Understand your enemies**\n\nWhat hero are they playing? What are they capable of?

The young Zuka could not understand why he needed to do this. Surely it would be better to help work the fields or engage in scholarly pursuits. In response to Zuka’s question, the teacher responded, ‘It is not enough to simply wish for peace, one must have ability to defend peace!’\n\nThose words left a deep impression on him. When the fallen souls that emerged from the demon abyss spread plague and chaos across the land, the once peaceful village was mercilessly engulfed in the flames of war. In an effort to flee, the young Zuka embarked on a long journey with his family, crossing treacherous mountains as they made their way to legendary Forest of Shadows.\n\nNot only was it home to the legendary Elven Queen, Tel’Annas, but there were also countless elemental and orc warriors. They were the Queen’s valiant army, charged with defending the land from evil.\n\nDuring the journey, Zuka witnessed all manner of depraved acts perpetrated by the fallen souls. The material arts that he had practiced for so many years finally had a use. Wearing armor symbolizing his coming of age, and wielding a staff he made with his own two hands, he fought countless battles against evil and saved those who had suffered at their hands.\n\nTales of Zuka’s heroic exploits spread far and wide. From the noble and proud Temple of Light, to the Castle of Inception, which has long been suspicious of animal races, all factions publicly commanded Zuka’s heroism. Even Queen Tel’Annas herself prepared a lavish welcome ceremony in his honor. ",

But Kondo always stood up for him. Kondo had studied under Ryoma's father and wanted to repay the kindness that his family had shown him.\n\nThe princes, both well-trained in the ways of the court, quickly turned on one another. Ryoma, now the chief military strategist for the younger prince, swiftly led the prince's army to several decisive victories. The elder prince, running out of options, concocted a dangerous plan to send Kondo's death squad to assassinate the younger prince.\n\nThe plan appeared to be successful as the squad reached the younger prince's throne without any resistance. Ryoma had anticipated this move from the elder prince, but was shocked to see Kondo and hesitated. Kondo and his squad took advantage of the momentary lapse and sliced through Ryoma's defenses effortlessly. There was no need to hold onto the past, and at that moment, he decided to give everything he had.\n\nSword in hand, Ryoma sliced through every single soldier that dared come near the prince. It was Kondo's turn to be surprised, but he had no choice but to press on. Kondo's attacks became sharper and more deadly as he taunted Ryoma. The duel ended when both launched one final attack. Ryoma buried his sword into Kondo's chest, but Kondo's blade had stopped at the last second, inches from Ryoma's throat.\n\n‘Why?’ Ryoma was confused. ‘I was always an orphan, I never had anyone other than you and my teacher. He'd be proud of y…’ Before Kondo could finish his sentence, Ryoma burst into tears. ",

The traumatic nature of the experience was enough to unmoor the last fastenings of the Joker's sanity. Rather than stand trial for his crimes, he was committed to Arkham Asylum. Here, the Joker was a comedian without a joke.\n\nThat changed when a new inmate was brought into Arkham. This man, too, was mad, but in between his demented ravings he spouted lucid streams of mathematical equations and whispered incantations in hushed tones. And when he would sleep, a single phrase was on his lips: ‘Athanor… Athanor.’ The man's madness intrigued the Joker. With some charm and deception Joker befriended the inmate and learned of where the man had come from. A scientist in a former life, the Arkham inmate had studied radiation spikes across the world that coincided with paranormal phenomena. The scientist had found the answer to these riddles: a portal to another world.\n\nThe scientist spoke of this realm, Athanor, with reverent tones. It was clear that the experience had changed the scientist profoundly. The Joker was not in search of spiritual enlightenment or an experience that would cure his madness; no, he longed to see this world of beauty and order, so that he might make a grand joke of it. With his mind finally resolved to a productive endeavor, the Joker escaped Arkham, as he had so many times before. This time, instead of wreaking havoc upon Gotham, the newly freed Joker made for Athanor. ",

However, Murad's ancestors were able to outsmart Azzen'Ka and acquire the fragments. They used the fragments to forge an extremely powerful weapon that could manipulate space and time, and built a new empire in the desert with its power.\n\nWhen Murad came of age, he inherited the weapon from his father and officially became the heir apparent. He led the imperial army on many expeditions. This eventually threatened the authority of Azzen'Ka who was furious after discovering the truth behind Murad's weapon. But Murad paid Azzen'Ka no mind.\n\nAzzen'Ka was forced to parley with Murad, and capitulate to the demands of the imperial prince. Murad gladly accepted his enemy's willingness to surrender, and missed the golden opportunity to rid the empire of a potential threat once and for all. From the shadows, Azzen’Ka manufactured multiple crises that forced Murad to use his weapon to defend the fledgling empire.\n\nOveruse of the power accelerated the Andura Stones' decay and, unable to withstand the burden, the weapon developed numerous cracks through which the power of space-time leaked. This efflux greatly weakened Murad's ability to fight, and Azzen'Ka seized the opportunity to conjure a mighty sandstorm that completely engulfed the once prosperous empire.\n\nBut he did not give up. Seeking a way to repair his weapon while accumulating the strength to confront Azzen'Ka. Murad firmly believes that as long as he has his weapon, he will one day be able to kill Azzen'Ka. ",

His remarkable martial exploits brought him status and influence. However, no one could understand why he refused the title of Guardian of the Forest of Shadows. He simply stated that the trappings of glory are incompatible with his free-spirited nature. \n\n'When you need me, I will sever the heads of your enemies, tear them limb from limb, and drink their blood. But the free wind should never be shackled.' That was the explanation he gave to Queen Tel'Annas. His unwavering loyalty and selflessness won the Queen's respect and trust. Before entering her slumber, she awarded Zill the right to exercise free will. Although this did not require him to undertake any specific duties, it allowed him complete access to the collective resources of the Forest of Shadows. \n\nFollowing this episode, Zill gradually faded from the public's attention. Other than the fairy Krixi who occasionally sensed his presence, no one else saw any trace of him. For a time, people completely forgot all about the hero who ruled the skies in the days of old. However, on the day of the Queen's awakening, Zill was the first to return to her side. For a thousand long years, Zill had given up the freedom he so desired to keep a silent vigil over the slumbering Tel'Annas. This was his way of repaying the unconditional trust she had placed in him.   ",

Admired by few and envied by none, Zephys carried the mantle of the harvester with unrivaled dignity, for only he understood the calamity that would ensue should he falter.\n\nIn times of war, Zephys led his undead army at the front; his ranks ever growing as he reaped.

He wielded the Hammer of Penance, which served as a warning to all blasphemers; and he carried the Oracle of Enlightenment, spreading its words to the people. Within the Holy Hall, Xeniel's diligence and devoutness were unparalleled. For this, Ilumia awarded him the Six Wings, representing light and power.\n\nXeniel's achievements were beyond Ilumia's expectations. During the dark invasions, Maloch and his legion of demons stormed the Holy Hall set on the mountaintop. Ilumia, in hopes of turning the tides of battle, appeared to boost the morale of her army in person. Lying in wait, Zephys and Nakroth took the opportunity to launch a surprise attack and ambush Ilumia, hoping to destroy her.\n\nXeniel, spreading his six wings, descended from the sky and rescued Ilumia in the nick of time. His brawny physique withstood the attacks of Zephys and Nakroth. Although Xeniel was injured by numerous blades and projectiles, he stood tall and firm with his wings drenched in blood. The demon legion was taken aback by Xeniel's resilience and their attack halted, giving Airi the chance to ride out on her own and forge the legend of cutting off the demon's wings.\n\nAfter the battle, word of Xeniel's bravery spread across the continent and he became the Commander of Holy Hall, the same position as Yorn the Hotshot.

	          "description": "Wonder Woman is Princess Diana of the immortal Amazons. When army pilot Steve Trevor crashed on the warriors' secluded island, Diana won the right to escort him home and make her people known to the world. Entering the world of humanity for the first time, Diana found a people who needed a hero. Over the years, the ways of mankind have vexed Diana, but her superhuman strength and the famed Lasso of Truth have aided her to bring order to humanity.\n\nWonder Woman's mission to promote peace on Earth is sometimes complicated by the political machinations and familial disagreements of her relatives. It was a message from her mother, Hippolyta, that eventually sent Wonder Woman to the realm of Athanor.\n\nHippolyta had kept a secret from Diana her whole life. Hippolyta confessed that she had a passionate affair with Zeus; the resulting child was none other than Diana. But Wonder Woman had no time to process the emotional uppercut she had just received, as she was attacked by Hera, Zeus' jealous wife and learning that Zeus had been missing from for some time. The ensuing battle involved many of the gods, but Wonder Woman was able to win by binding Hera with her Lasso of Truth.\n\nKnowing that without peace on Olympus, Earth and humanity would be threatened, Wonder Woman took it upon herself to find Zeus. But Hippolyta cautioned that Athanor was too challenging. There were gods in Athanor, with strange powers and magic that would rival all. But Athanor has never seen a hero like Wonder Woman. And when she eventually finds Zeus, what he tells her will have grave ramifications, not just for Olympus... but Earth as welll. ",

Long did she pray and beseech their wisdom, but long have they remain silent.\n\nEager to prove her mettle, she attempted to take on the Ravagers alone. Surely with their demise by her hand, the Great Ones would reward her with glory. However, it may also be that hubris, which the Great Ones found distasteful.\n\nThough she fought bravely and peerlessly, inevitably she was captured. The tortures she suffered need not be mentioned. All that matters was those bright eyes, which once looked up to the heavens for guidance, are now filled with malice and dark fire.\n\nMaloch, the leader of the Ravagers, personally performed the tortures, which founded a dark and awful relationship between the two. From then on she was always by his side, commanding his armies and vanquishing his foes.\n\nBut she always preferred the silent approach, bringing down the mightiest foes with her wiles and charms. Tome upon tome had been written to warn off men who might ever come across her path to not to listen to the dark shadows whispering promises of greatness; all that lies at the end of that road is doom.\n\nThe Queen of Night is patient. She knows ultimately she will always have her way. She will be the last one standing. She still dreams of the day she can bathe in the Great Ones' blood and look them in the eyes, so that they may know her wrath. ",

As the master of Emerald Mountain and Thunder Mountain, Toro was one of the very few heroes in the world capable of putting up a fight against Sun Wukong, thanks to his own magic abilities. The mighty Monkey King, who even 100,000 celestial warriors and thousands of talismans could not tame, was willing to bow to Toro out of pure admiration. Eventually, the two became sworn brothers.\n\nBut Toro could have never imagined what happened next: Sun Wukong killed Immortal Ruyi Toro's brother, to protect that band of monks journeying to the West for scriptures. Then he kidnapped Red Boy, Toro's son, and sent him to Guanyin. Finally, he got involved in the love-triangle between the Iron Fan Princess, the Jade-Faced Fox and Toro.\n\n'We are sworn brothers, so why is he always messing with me?' Toro was angry and really wanted to give the stupid monkey a beating. But Wukong had become a God, and may not even acknowledge Toro even if they met again. So Toro was was glad to have found out that Sun Wukong would join in the battle.\n\n'Where is that stupid monkey? Let me teach him a lesson with my fists.' ",

The previous king had recently passed away and the knights were too engage in combat to decide who would ascend to the throne. However, Thane effortlessly pulled the sword from the stone and put an end to the tournament. Inscribed on the sword were the words 'He who draws this sword from the stone shall be king.'\n\nOnce king, Thane led the Knights of the Round Table and defeated the powerful enemy that threatened his kingdom.

The brothers had to get jobs cleaning up the battlefields in exchange for food and daily necessities. Even so, Mee never let any opportunity slip him by. ‘Finders keepers!’ he would say.\n\nWhen the humans and the Veda joined the war, TeeMee began to find stranger items, the most valuable of which being the armor of a knight. It was just large enough to fit both brothers and was engraved with the Vedan symbol for ‘resurrection.’ The masterpiece was built by Max the Wunderkind. Sweeping (and scavenging) the battlefield may not have compared to the fray of war, but it was still rife with danger. Still, they never in their wildest dreams expected this armor to save their lives.\n\nOne day, in the midst of battle, the Lokheim army suddenly retreated. After the opposing army had cleared their troops from the battlefield, they sent in a crew to sweep up the battlefield, TeeMee among them. It was at this time that the Lokheim army returned. Forced into battle, Mee used all his wits to guide Tee and their allies on the battlefield, leading them to fight back from higher ground.\n\nAnd Tee, faced with the threat of death, grew focused and determined. He followed Mee's every command and even put himself between their allies and danger. With the armor's incredible defenses and the power from the engraving, TeeMee held off the Lokheim army until the army returned and proceeded to crush their enemies. After the battle, the brothers were showered with praise and gratitude, and it gave them a swell of pride. ",

The tribe led by Taara achieved many feats in the warring era. Though they lack the necessary crafting skills for fine weapons, they held their crudely-made hammers in Valiance <:Valiance3:421472411666612224>  and smashed down on the invading Fallen at the foot of the mountains. Bloodbath after bloodbath, Taara's tribe paid dearly. However, even on the verge of losing the entire Iron Mountain Range, surrender never entered Taara's mind.\n\nOn the day of the resurgence of light, Taara and her tribesmen held a great festival. They lit the furnace deep in the mountains and celebrated with pillars of raging flames. Thane's messengers came at this time, announcing the order of the new king; due to Taara's Valiance <:Valiance3:421472411666612224>  in the war, she was conferred a noble title. This meant she now owned a wealthy piece of land in the new kingdom and her tribe was finally able to escape the life of material shortages and hard mining work.\n\nHowever, before Taara could plan her transition, Gildur's fury had spread to the Iron Mountains. As the Holy Hall's financial officer, Gildur knew that population meant production capacity, and he would not allow Thane to destabilize the cornerstones of the Order. Thane's messenger was exiled, and Taara was regarded as a traitor to the faith and imprisoned. In addition, the taxes for her tribe would be doubled for the next ten years as a punishment. ",

The knowledge that his true home, the planet Krypton, is but stardust and solar debris.\n\nThat all changed on a fateful autumn day, when Superman encountered one of his greatest foes. The villain Brainiac, descended upon Earth with a fleet of advanced robotic drones. It took every last ounce of Superman's power to defeat Brainiac. The Man of Steel's endurance won out, and before dispatching Brainiac, his X-ray vision spotted something with a bright, glowing aura. Superman removed the glittering gem from Brainiac's armor and felt a surge of power ripple through his spine. Immediately distrustful of the object's incredible power, Superman retreated to the Fortress of Solitude to analyze the rare artifact.\n\nThe Fortress of Solitude's computer could find no analog for the artifact's substance anywhere in the galaxy. However, there was one clue that the artifact found: a log from Kryptonian scientist Jor-El's father. This object, which could have given Brainiac the key to domination of the entire Earth, was only one piece of a much larger whole! The Andura Shard originated in a realm called Athanor, a place beyond even the Phantom Zone.\n\nBut Jor-El was right. As Superman eagerly combed through the Fortress of Solitude's archives, he learned that ancient Kryptonians had explored the galaxy in search of the Andura Shards. But as Superman searched the Fortress of Solitude, it was revealed that Brainiac had redoubled his search for the Andura Shards and, if he claimed this ultimate source of their power, all of Earth would be in danger.

His powerful fists could shake the courage of anyone who attempted to overthrow the dark rule. During the warring years, Skud was summoned to serve as Preyta’s subordinate and lead the Fallen to charge forward.\n\nThe battle for the Castle of Alchemy proved to be the pinnacle of Skud’s achievements. Even though he had fewer than one hundred men, he successfully led them to break through the mechanical defenses that were laid by Moen, the arms specialist. Then he single-handedly destroyed ten alchemy puppets and fought his way into the castle interior. At that moment, Omega, who had been undercover for some time, issues an order to attack. Soon Skud and his men were flooded by a sea of steel.\n\nAs he watched the Castle of Alchemy’s defenses rose again and found himself surrounded by enemies, Skud became infuriated beyond reproach. The demonic blood in his body started boiling and his willpower was ignited. The iron Blitzcould not stall his progress. The strongest of armor crumpled like paper under his fists. The enraged Skud managed to single-handedly squash the enemy counterattack. Omega grabbed Moen and fled in panic, leaving Skud and his Fallen followers to enjoy the bounty of treasures and recourses left by the army.\n\nWhen the battle finally ended, Skud got the reward he deserved: a set of alchemy gloves forged by Moen himself. Mganga made some adjustments that allowed the alchemy gloves to bond with Skud’s demonic blood, giving him even more violent destructive powers. ",

Earning his favor, Raz was made head of a small strike team in Preyta's army. Using his authority and guile, Raz was always able to stay two steps ahead of the Corrupted, leveraging sabotage and subterfuge to impede the dark army.\n\nHowever, Preyta was no fool. He could smell a rat. He laid careful machinations to catch the traitor in his midst, even Raz was blissfully unaware until it was too late. While pursuing a false lead, he fell into Preyta's trap. He was immediately surrounded by an ocean of corrupted souls.\n\nUttering foul curses, Preyta and his ilk closed in around Raz. He could sense that the end was near, but he could not just lay down and accept this kind of fate. Using his last bit of strength Raz lashed out with a fury never before seen in Athanor. His fists were on fire, lighting up his foes and his rage, until finally he broke through. However, his hands were badly broken and his spirit greatly wounded.\n\nRaz limped his way back into Thane's court where he collapsed onto the ground. To save his friend, Thane rushed Raz to the citadel and beseeched the angel Lauriel for aid. But in order to receive the Light's blessing, Raz would have to undergo a grueling trial, and if he failed, he would die.\n\nBut luckily, he did not. Not only did Raz triumph and heal himself, he was stronger than he was even before. His gauntlets glowed a crimson light that grew steadily stronger as his resolve to vanquish the Corrupted grew ever more steeled. ",

Empowered by the rot, a new creature was born.\n\nAll living things were susceptible to the plague and Preyta knew just how well and quickly it could spread in time of war. Bards told tales of battlefields decimated by the purveyor of pestilence. He could appear anytime, on any battlefield, and rain down a putrid virus capable of consuming all life.\n\nPreyta could cause even the bravest of souls to cower in fear.

In fact, after Aleister defected from the Bright Temple, he started coveting the Fountain of Light under Laurie's protection. After all, it was a key ingredient for his magic experiments.\n\nLauriel fell under siege of the Fallen and suffered severe injuries. She was left with no other choice but to escape into the Dark Forest. This is when she encountered the forest guardian, Peura, who lent her a helping hand.\n\nHowever, Peura had no way to resist the destructive power of Aleister's magic. In order to prevent Aleister from succeeding, Lauriel handed the Fountain of Light to Peura and stood her ground so that she may escape. Aleister was very cunning however. He didn't give them any chance as he dropped thunder on them and turned them black and blue.\n\n'I will drink this all before I let him succeed!' The weakened Peura used her last bit of energy to drink the Fountain of Light and the light energy it contained burst throughout her body. In fact, the overflow of power even burst forward and healed the prostrate Lauriel before her eyes. With Peura's help, Lauriel recovered and successfully defeated Aleister.\n\nAfter it was all over, Lauriel invited Peura to join the Temple of Light, but she politely refused. 'I have a sworn oath to protect the Dark Forest, but visitors from the Bright Temple will always be considered friends.' ",

Even demons born of the same abyss refused to stand by him, fearing that his chill would wipe them away.\n\nDespite this, Omen rarely graced the stage of war. For Omen lived only to kill - not just his enemies, but fellow demons and the Lokheim fighting alongside him. All who could use him, feared him. Suffice to say, he was a loose cannon nobody wanted.\n\nThe leader of the Lokheim, Maloch, was at a loss. He understood Omen was the physical manifestation of the Lokheim's desire to kill, and that retribution would be swift should he try to leash Omen's abilities. In the end, Maloch could only hide Omen away in the abyss. There he stayed, forgotten, until Arduin's army invaded Maloch's ranks.\n\nMaloch was badly injured and Veera was busy leading what was left of their army against Arduin's main forces. Neither had the energy to spare to defend themselves against Arduin's reinforcements. In desperation, Omen was awakened from his deep slumber, unleashing the murderous desires suppressed for many years. Omen stood alone on the passage of frost, fighting off every last member of Arduin's army. No tales of this battle were ever shared as there was no one left alive to tell them. ",

Ormarr had wielded his massive hammer and sword in countless clan battles, and was always the first to attack and the last to withdraw. His adept fighting abilities and thirst for battle had earned him the nickname 'The Frenzy', as well as the respect of all of his enemies and his people.\n\nIt had always been Ormarr's dream to become the leader of his clan, but in his pursuit for power, he made many foolish decisions. He once tried to raid the supplies of an ally, and this lead to his clan being banished to the ice fields of the north. Strangely enough, this did nothing to harm Ormarr's reputation. On the contrary, his people stood firmly behind him as he fought for glory.\n\nOrmarr had never disappointed his clan. When the Demon Army engulfed the continent, Ormarr volunteered to lead the campaign to defend his clan's fortress. Outsiders were so impressed by his bravery that they flocked to the fortress, bringing in emergency supplies, reinforcements, and support. From then on, no one dared to describe Ormarr and his clan as 'barbarians' again. ",

Omega was one of a kind. It belonged to no specific realm or civilization, yet it possessed intelligence, self-awareness, controlled behavior, and a natural instinct to wage war. Theories suggested that Omega was part of an ancient, powerful, and mysterious civilization that proceeded all civilizations and divine realms of the present. Yet he was the only living proof of it, and was alienated by this world because of it.\n\nThe intrigue of Omega's origins were not important, for the more pressing issue was its abilities and their contrasting connotations. Omega's compulsion to wage war and his Prowess in battles had led suspicions to rise among the gods. They had every reason to doubt by which method Omega was created to end all wars ",

Natalya, a descendant of these warriors, also carried the parasite.\n\nWhen one of the tribe fell to insanity caused by the overwhelming power, the warrior was devoured, and his strength was absorbed by the rest of the tribe. To fight the external threats, the Temple quarantined the tribe to breed stronger hosts.\n\nNatalya happened to be the best descendant the Temple had seen in years. To appease her, the Temple even sent an emissary with extravagant gifts to her coming-of-age ceremony. What they did not know was that Natalya had grown tired of the humiliating quarantine and did not want to see her tribe falling insane.\n\n'I will bear all the sins!' She devoured her entire tribe during the ceremony to end their cursed destiny. With her head held high, Natalya showed her determination to break away from the Temple, for she knew very well that the root of the curse was the ambitious Temple. \n\nNatalya faded into darkness and managed to split from the Poison Fang with curses from the same school of magic. In exchange, she swore allegiance to Veera. With Poison Fang by her side as a loyal pet, Natalya held the power to rain destruction in her wake.  ",

The hunger from two days without food and the effects of drugs infused with dark magic were constantly eating away at what was left of her mind.\n\nMganga looked down upon Mina with satisfaction. He could tell that she was nearing the breaking point. The experiment far exceeded his expectations. You must hold on just a little longer, my dear, Mganga said while putting away the equipment, one more day, and you shall be reborn. However, he failed to notice the growing cracks on the straps which had Mina bound.\n\n'Your turn now. Do you want to live or die?'\n\nMganga was caught off guard by the voice behind him. It's not time yet… how did you… Mina's scythe was upon him before he could finish, but Veera, who had been watching in silence, finally made her move as her slender hand effortlessly pushed away the scythe. Mina's savage eyes softened before Veera's charm.\n\nVeera was happy with the results, and Mganga got the reward he deserved. As for Mina… her identity and unspeakable secrets were buried together with the remains of the lab, and the Mina that bows before Veera now is the Reaper Queen. ",

Old Moren may be contentious and rude, but he spared no expense when it came to Max's education.\n\nMeanwhile, Moren was still mired in the shadows in Skud's wake. His productivity and quality was taking a hard hit as he tossed out priceless machinery like trash. This trash became a source of income for Max, and he, in turn, was inspired to become an inventor.\n\nMax's ‘riches’ provoked the ire of the other vagrants. They banded together to chase the young orphan off their streets. Knowing he was outnumbered, Max wisely opted to retreat, at least until he built himself a mechanical weapon from the scrap parts he had collected, and returned to teach those bullies a lesson.\n\nAwakened by the noise, Moren was impressed by what he witnessed. The weapon Max held was rough around the edges but it held a certain sleekness to it. He invited Max into his home and questioned him about it. Upon discovering that Max had built it himself, Moren immediately offered to take the young genius under his wing. Max saw no reason to say no to the generous offer.\n\nUnder Moren's tutelage, Max learned the intricacies of building machines. He built vehicles and even transformed the realm's feeblest soldiers into ruthless fighting machines equal to any other warrior in the field. With his inventions, Max became the youngest human in the realm to be knighted. ",

Maloch was always proud to demonstrate his cold intellect and vile schemes, and was quick to refute any rumors about his foolhardiness. \n\nMaloch's cruelty knew no bounds, and he frequently delighted himself by torturing the Ravenors under his command until their very souls were broken. It helped passing his time, but Maloch gradually grew tired of them as well. \n\n'Every living soul must lay broken, weeping and pleading for death at my feet!' He thought to himself.

He could not suppress this anger for much longer. Such victories meant nothing to him. What he desired was a good fight with a real opponent. He loved nothing more than pushing himself when in danger, and that was how he came to be known as the 'Peerless Warlord.'\n\nLu Bu began to reminisce of his battle against Liu Bei, Guan Yu and Zhang Fei at Hulao Gate. It did indeed seem unfair to fight against the three of them, but Lu Bu was accustomed to these kinds of odds. Truth be told, it was highly unlikely that any other mortal could match him in single combat.\n\n'Tell me, am I the strongest warrior in the world?'\n\nLu Bu seldom showed his gentle side as he shone resplendently in his armor. The enchanting Diaochan smiled sweetly at this, and fished out a note from her sleeve.\n\n'There may be no one in this world worth fighting with. But, my General, how about the opponents in Heaven? Would you care to battle against them?'\n\n'In Heaven?! That's it!'\n\nLu Bu could not hide the excitement in his eyes. ",

	          "description": "Liliana considered the Fox her master and was influenced by the creature that she identified herself as a Nine-tailed Fox thereafter. She lived in seclusion but would emerge from solitude every few hundred years to gather more wisdom.\n\nDuring her previous journey, Liliana came in contact with Humans. Yet after she learned more about the thirst Humans had for knowledge she soon became fascinated by them and began following their innovations and developments closely. Whenever Humans advanced, Liliana transformed into one to learn from scholars.\n\nDuring the Dark Era, Humans were often attacked by Abyssal Beings. Not wanting to just sit back and watch the suffering, Liliana revealed methods on wielding magic to aid them. She considered the aid she offered Humans as a kind of investment. With a smile and high hopes for the future, Liliana went back into hiding.\n\nIn the future, when Liliana returned to the Humans she was shocked. The candles and fireplaces were replaced by crystal lamps carved with magical arrays. The blades and swords she once knew were no longer used. Instead, Humans now favored incredibly powerful mechanical weapons. These improvements, which Humans called ‘technology’, completely changed how Liliana saw the world.\n\nIt was an ideal turn of events for Liliana, who was eager to gobble up all new developments available. But even one with her level of wisdom would need dozens of years to digest all this. Not to mention that new inventions were popping up practically every day! Therefore Liliana decided to transform into a Human and join the Empirical Army. ",

She devoutly obeyed the words of the Great Ones and was thereby imbued with their almighty power. She was their herald, spreading truth to the Great One's followers, in whose eyes, she was the embodiment of their Grace and Righteousness.\n\nThe sincerity of Lauriel's belief gave her unrivaled power and, for a while, wielded control over reincarnation itself. During that time, the rebirth, resurrection, and guidance of souls through reincarnation were all under Lauriel's control. The flapping of her wings would bring new life into being, while the closing of her wings would throw life into yet another cycle of toil.\n\nWhile doing battle with the army of the Fallen, the followers once witnessed Lauriel spreading her wings and charging the enemy ranks. The lightning she summoned arched and sliced through the demonic horde in a single blow. The forces under her command were then fearless in their mission of vanquishing the army of the Fallen.  ",

However, whenever danger draws near, Krixi's cruel side would emerge in full force. She would use her sharp fangs and claws to shred any demon who intrudes upon the forest.\n\nWhat really broke Krixi's heart was seeing the humans, whom she once considered her companions, destroying the forest for material wealth. Their armies were highly organized and armed to the teeth, so Krixi gathered the inhabitants of the forest in an effort to fight off the human invaders. The plan worked, and she was able to coerce the humans into signing a peace treaty.\n\nThe forest quickly returned to its peaceful and serene state, but Krixi knew that the invaders' ambitions weren't much different from that of the demons. She began training wild creatures with human methods and formed her own powerful beast army in hopes to prevent future invasions! ",

Of course, Kriknak was not concerned by matters such as life or death. The only thing it cared about was the orders from its master, Searcy the Banshee.\nAs Searcy's devoted servant, there was nothing Kriknak was unwilling to do for its master. Even when it meant facing Claves Sancti {cla)  in the hands of Thane himself, Kriknak stood strong in front of its master and used its proud horns to block any blow that came forth. These horns ended up being ruthlessly cleaved away by Thane, but Kriknak's loyalty was rewarded through Searcy's trust and gifts.\nSearcy, in turn, reluctantly pulled off her own horns to treat Kriknak's severely depleted energies, and transplanted them by infusing it with powerful spiritual energy. As the new horns took hold, the souls of Kriknak and Searcy converged completely.\nEven if they were separated by a thousand miles, Kriknak would always know what its master was thinking, and would spare no effort to complete any task it was assigned to.

The only thing cared about was instilling the fury of killing in all sea creatures. As for what they killed, well, that was up to them.\n\nRelentless slaughter served as the source of power of Kil'Groth's rage. Fresh blood diffusing into the seas aroused swarms upon swarms of deep sea predators which then filled the gaps left in the food chain. Such intense rage power was intoxicating for the demons.\n\nTaara, commander of the Fallen, wielded her hammer like the coming of a cyclone. She used the power of absolute zero ice to freeze the ocean surface. The water, which was heated by fresh blood, cooled and even Kil’Groth felt the effects. His pride, however, did not allow him to flee a fight. His raging will blazed and freed Kil’Groth from his icy confines. He picked up his massive sea blade and began his last charge towards the intruder.\n\nMany hundreds died at Kil’Groth’s hands, but, under the command of Taara, the flood of the Fallen drowned him like a massive tidal wave. When the bloody battle ended, the dying Kil’Groth lacked the strength to even hold his weapon. In fact, if Cresht hadn’t led the beast army to the rescue, Kil’Groth may have died there and become a legend in his own right.\n\nHowever, Kil’Groth recovered from his wounds and ended up joining the Forest of Shadows array to show his gratitude as well as exact revenge.

Jinnar's ancestors solely relied on the orbs' power to defend themselves and to defeat the demons of Hell.\n\nIt was an infinite battle that never ceased. The more the orbs were exposed to dark forces in battle, the more they became tainted with evil. In order to seal the orbs, Jinnar's ancestors sacrificed their souls to protect future generations.\n\nThe war against the dark forces inevitably continued. Jinnar took it upon himself to travel to the Temple of Light, a sanctuary in which the orbs would be safe.\n\nEn route to the temple, the traces of evil within the orbs emitted dark energies to Hell, drawing the attention of Maloch the Merciless. Instantaneously, Jinnar was captured by his minions. In that critical moment, outnumbered and badly injured, Jinnar was convinced he was deprived of hope, and that, resistance was futile... until something awakened within the orbs.\n\nThe remaining soul energy from his ancestors was awakened, leading Jinnar to victory. The orbs would finally be delivered to the temple.\n\nUsing his spiritual powers, control, and knowledge over the Spirit Orbs, he gained unanimous approval from the temple to protect them. A newfound desire to grow stronger in order to better protect the orbs and future generations sparked. Lauriel aided him in practicing advanced Zen techniques, which he painfully withstood without uttering a word. Jinnar knew that the purifying power of the light obtained from the advanced Zen techniques could completely cleanse the orbs of their dark energy.  ",

He read countless ancient texts, among which he discovered Holy Flame manipulation spells that had been long forgotten. Unfortunately the Holy Flame burned out a century ago, making his discovery worthless. Everyone in the Temple lamented this fact. However, Ignis was delighted. His study of the Holy Flame had brought him one step closer to the Kingdom of Truth that he had dreamed of for so long.\n\nNo one could have anticipated that Ignis' next discovery had the potential to break the balance between light and dark. Commanded by the Lord of Darkness, a demon army mounted an attack on the Temple. The terrified scholars fled, but the resolute Ignis refused to leave. To protect the precious texts, he willingly endured the agonizing burns inflicted by the raging inferno.\n\n‘If this is to be my fate, then bury me in the Kingdom of Truth along with this precious knowledge!’ This sincere prayer invoked the power of a holy light. Ignis was shocked to see that the red flames of hell had been turned to a holy white by this power. It was the Holy Flame that Ignis had yearned to see for so many years.n\nIgnis recited a Holy Flame manipulation spell almost instinctively, and the Holy Flame formed a wall of fire, just as he had willed it to. ‘The invaders will be destroyed. The Holy Flame will tear the flesh from their bodies and incinerate their bones!’ Brought to the brink of defeat, the Temple guard managed to regroup under Ignis' protection and emerged victorious. Later, Ignis returned to the Tower and continued his journey. ",

He tried to numb the emptiness with alcohol and the companionship of beautiful women, but that did not help. That was when the Temple of Light, advocating soul-cleansing, caught his attention.\n\nThe ritualistic religion quickly filled the void inside Gildur, but being the calculative person that he is, Gildur realized that the fervor was not any different from his previous endeavors; he was in no hurry to leave though. After experiencing a religious life, he realized it could be potentially profitable. The hierarchy within the Temple gave him more reasons to seek power.\n\nHis wealth quickly paved the way for him to rise through the hierarchy and become one of the most powerful men on the continent.

She had just learned the art of Sleeve Dancing and with it, she had already managed to seduce all the men who frequented Chang'an Avenue. An old official claimed: 'This girl must be the incarnation of heavenly sin!' before falling at her feet, eager to catch the fragrance of her dress.\n\nEven the mighty Lu Bu could not resist Diaochan's beauty. When she frowned, Lu Bu was ready to slay his own godfather, Dong Zhuo, for unintentionally offending this beauty with his glance. The very sight of Diaochan's sad face was cause enough for Lu Bu to kill.\n\nDiaochan was indeed beautiful, but her beauty was matched by her manipulative nature. Heroes all over the world came to challenge Lu Bu to become Diaochan's new champion. Most of them were killed with a single strike. In fear, some banded together and yet met the same fate. Seeing his enemies multiply and Lu Bu's thirst for battle grew, Diaochan quietly left the man who loved her so deeply in one stormy morning. ",

The only relevant knowledge that man was able to garner came from a bard's song: ‘A monstrosity rising from the sea's hungry depths; its trident so terrible it brings naught but death.’\n\nIn the War of Man and Beast, Cresht fought fearlessly on the front lines, endlessly tormenting the humans.

The target could escape at any moment, and she only had a few clues. As if celebrating the occasion, little Halloween pumpkin lamps hung on every door in the long corridor, seemingly for the Monster Festival.\n\nThe Butterfly had a very keen sense of intuition; only one of the doors was not locked. A dim light came from inside through the half-shut door, it was meant to tell passersby that there was no one inside. She drew closer to the door slowly, and a beefy figure gradually came into sight from the darkness, just as she had anticipated. Her target saw her at the same time she spotted him. He wasn't empty-handed; the hunting-knife in his hand frightened her.\n\n'I don't think I'll lose when it comes to using a knife!'\n\nIt was only after years of training that the Butterfly became confident enough about her knife-fighting abilities. A single meter, just enough for her to turn and charge at the enemy. Blade in. Blade out. The figure collapsed. ",

And it was through a bruising encounter with Zephys that Batman pieced together the existence of Athanor. He had come to subdue the earth and build a new world. One that would be subjugated by Athanor and be forced to provide fresh troops for its eternal war.\n\nDuring the tumult, Batman found himself chasing Zephys, passing through countless world. Finally catching up to him, Batman sought to end Zephys' dark plot right then and there. However, he just could not find an opening to end the fight. Suddenly, the hero Valhein appeared, under orders from Thane, to investigate the strange rumblings of doom. With his aid, Batman finally beat back Zephys and temporarily banished him back to his realm.\n\n’Traveler, welcome to Athanor.’ Valhein whispered in a deep voice.Stepping into the light, he found himself in Thane's court. The resplendent king sat high above the rest as a gloomy pall hung over the room. He thanked the Dark Knight for subduing Zephys and handed him a shining gem.\n\nUpon touching the gem, Batman experienced a vision of fire and despair. Gotham lay in ruins, consumed by flames that licked the air. Its inhabitants were being led towards the darkness in chains. And above all of this sat a malevolent shadow that seemed to glow brighter than the very flames swallowing the city.\n\n‘This isn't real, is it?’ were his only words. Thane finally spoke ‘It is what will come to pass, if we sit idle.’ He continued, ‘The Andura fragment you hold must be returned whole. It has the power to create, and a devastating power to destroy.’ ",

Anyone who wished to pass through the desert must make an offering to him or be forever lost. The treacherous terrain had isolated the desert from the rest of the world, and the endless storms have prevented the other gods from entering, leaving Azzen'Ka as the true ruler of the desert.\n\nThane had more than once led his army into the desert in attempts to conquer this sandy realm beyond the control of the gods. However, failure after failure had made it clear that Azzen'Ka had nothing to fear from anyone in his domain. Even the Grim Reaper himself had no choice but to admit that the desert was beyond his control. Although he was confident he could defeat Azzen'Ka, he did not consider himself capable of pacifying the sandstorms.\n\nNumerous writings accused Azzen'Ka of being evil, yet travelers reported that Azzen'Ka would guarantee their safety as long as they make an offering to him. This made him more honest and trustworthy than any of the gods in the heavens. It was for this reason that opinions of him were extremely polarized. Some feared and respected him as a god, while others simply loathed him. Azzen'Ka, of course, could not care less. ",

She raised the Flaming Rose standard high and stood next to Thane, showing the world the allegiance of an old noble house to the new king.\n\nWith Astrid's support, the doubts that followed Arduin's death eventually quieted and people started to reflect on the failure of Arctica. Even though Astrid's father and brother died in the war, she did not pay any mind to gossip and whispers from the Temple. Her support in Thane's ascension provided some much-needed stability in times of conflict.\n\nIn return, Thane awarded unprecedented honor to the Rose family, and Astrid became the kingdom's first duchess. But before she could do anything with her territory, dark powers returned with Taara leading the charge. Arduin and Mina, corrupted by dark power, were spotted among their ranks.\n\nAstrid knew that the murderous leader was one of those responsible for her father's and brother's deaths. She could not wait to join the battle and avenge them, but Thane gently stopped her. Looking at the girl with affection and care, Thane said, ‘You have done enough for me. I shall take care of the rest.’\n\n‘My lord, I don't think you understand,’ said Astrid with her head held high, showing resolve that no man of her age would ever possess. ‘I took my vows as a knight. Dukes can wait in their castles for news of victory, but knights must charge into battle!’ With that said, she unclasped her crimson mantle, unsheathed Embertrail and led her knights to war. ",

Facing frenzied beasts and bloodthirsty demons, the humans lacked not only the strength to defend themselves but also guidance from the gods, which could have prevented their civil wars. This era of turmoil persisted until Arthur rose.\n\nArthur’s chivalry was well-received and admired by all, drawing brave human warriors from far and wide to pledge their allegiance to him. Under his leadership, they formed a valiant order of knights trained in the art of war. They marched under the banner of justice and valor in the name of Arthur. They toured the land, exterminating evil along the way. Most importantly, they established order and peace amidst the darkness, ensuring humanity’s survival.\n\nThe deeds of the Order greatly impeded the demon Legion’s invasion plans. Arthur had become a thorn in Maloch’s side, and his knights were attacked at every turn. However, the Order was not shaken one bit. Arthur and his knights resolutely stood their ground. Their resilience and persistence inspired all.\n\nThis band of brothers, loyal to both the chivalric spirit and their leader gradually grew into a force to be reckoned with. humans, long looked down on by the other races, were finally earning the recognition and respect of all.\n\nEven their age-long rival, the Afata, extended the hand of friendship to Arthur. The secluded Veda brought the blessings of the gods upon the Order and its knights. Arthur and his chivalric spirit gave courage to humankind and his successors, notably Thane. ",

After years, Arduin finally accepted Thane as an ally and heir friendship grew.\n\nThe duo was fundamental to the reel's victory. In the last battle, Arduin and Than quarreled for the first time in a long time. Arduin wanted to keep on battling, in hopes of obliterating the dark forces and bringing back the long-awaited peace, while Thane thought such an action would only devastate what they had achieved so far.\n\nFailing to persuade him, Arduin abandoned Thane and, together with his warriors and supporting Vedän squads, marched into Ineri to hunt down the remaining Fallen and demons. Yet, Arduin's legion was misled to the Icy Terrain by the cunning Veera. She ignited the frost fire, hoping to annihilate the entire legion. Feeling a deep regret of his own decision, Arduin strode through the frost fire and created a storm by swinging his ax, attempting to create a safe passage for his warriors.\n\nThanks to Arduin's resourcefulness, a few soldiers managed to survive, but many of their fellows perished in the unforgiving frost fire. Even arduin himself was scorched in battle, but was saved by the Vedä-blessed armor. Despite the fact that Arduin swung his ax blindly, he managed to kill any enemies who dared to come close.\n\nVeera swiftly stepped in and stopped the Fallen from taking revenge.Soon, Arduin's body was burned to ashes, and though his spirit remained, it was marked with a dark seal by Veera. Freezing frost fire replaced the Holy Force and became the sole driving force of the armor. ",

The other maidens doted on her, akin to a mother's love for her child.\n\nAs childlike and innocent as she was, the word fear was not understood by her. Even in the presence of the temple leader, she did not hold back her playfulness. The smile that she shared with everyone from the bottom of her heart never failed to win people over.\n\nBut it would be foolhardy to underestimate her because of her kindhearted nature. When the Fallen invaded, Alice left the temple and joined the resistance. Her participation, skill, and magic, greatly bolstered the army's combat strength. With her outstanding contribution, Alice received the title of ‘the Princess’.\n\n’Don't get on the wrong side of this little princess.’\n\nThis warning was always wise to bear in mind. Indeed, all of the enemies that Alice defeated serve to underpin this advice, further proving her Prowess . If you were fortunate enough to witness Alice during battle, you would be amazed at how one so small can unleash such a godly force with cataclysmic effects. ",

Despite Aleister's intelligence, he didn't possess a strong will and he fell into the darkness due to Veera's charm.\n\nThough on a different note, Aleister's brilliance had a huge impact on the war. His endless tricks and traps helped the Fallen to defeat the resistance forces time after time.\n\nTo eliminate the master think tank behind the dark power, Yorn left glory behind and led an elite team deep into enemy territory to assassinate Aleister.

In that moment, Maloch was unable to lift his own weapon.\n\nThe blade rose and fell. Blood hotter than lava gushed out from a wound in Maloch’s chest and the impregnable demon wings were tattered.

	        "{  "description": "We've heard from the community that you would all love more quests to complete and rewards to work towards, especially after reaching account level 30. To that end, we're introducing the Valor Pass!\n\nWith the Battlefield Reborn update, all players will have immediate access to the Valor Pass and can start upgrading it to unlock free rewards. The Valor Pass will have two tiers: one that is free and accessible for everyone, and an Elite tier that must be purchased to unlock, providing access to additional rewards for each level.\n\nDaily Quests and Weekly Quests can be completed to gain Valor Points which increase the level of the Valor Pass. Up to three Daily Quests can be stored at once, with one new daily quest refreshed each day. Unfinished quests will expire in 72 hours. As a bonus for dedicated players who complete all of their daily quests in a week, there will be an extra reward.\n\nWe're really excited to roll this out soon and can't wait to hear what you all think of it!",  "author": {    "name": "Earn Rewards With The Valor Pass"\n  },\n  "color": 9109504,\n  "image": "http://overseas-img.qq.com/upload/webplat/info/bodproximabeta/20180824/1535059280692594.png"\n}"
